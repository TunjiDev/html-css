            <p>Twenty-Fifth Baam (스물다섯번째 밤, Seumooldahseotbeonjjae Bahm; "Twenty-Fifth Night") or simply Baam for short, is an Irregular and the main protagonist of Tower of God. 
                Baam entered the Tower in search of his best friend Rachel, another Irregular, who wanted to climb to the top of the Tower and see the stars. 
                Prior to passing Headon's test, he was deemed worthy of climbing the Tower. Before ascending, however, Baam is required to pass the Testing Floors (starting at Floor 2) which are there to weed out anyone that could be harmful to the Tower, and he puts together a strong team in the process. 
                After later being forcibly recruited into FUG, Baam joined Team Tangsooyook and managed to escape from FUG's clutches, eventually reuniting with his old friends and teammates. 
                Due to his affiliations with FUG, he also goes by the name Jyu Viole Grace (쥬 비올레 그레이스, Jyu Biolle Geuleiseu). After the battle of the last station, he decided to return to FUG in order to become more powerful to track down Kallavan and prepare for the war against his army.
            </P>
            <p>He is currently on the 52nd floor with his team.</p>

                She longs to see the stars which is one of the fabled rewards waiting at the top of the Tower, because she "fears the Night".
            </p>
            <p>Having once been a member of Khun's team, she now works alongside FUG. 
                After the events that took place on the Last Station, she was last seen being taken to the floating castle of Po Bidau Family, along with Ha Yura.

            <p>He is one of many "defected sons" of Khun Eduan. He was expelled from his family because his older sister failed to become one of Zahard's Princesses. 
                He teamed up with Baam and Rak and passed multiple tests with them. He was assigned the Light Bearer position and showed clear talent in the field. 
                He is a highly cunning Regular, who manipulates rules of tests to suit his needs.

                She is also the owner of Black March and Green April, two of the 13 Month Series Ignition Weapons. She is the first Princess to own two 13 Months at the same time since Garam Zahard, and the only other Princess known to have achieved such. 
                Notably, she is one of the most famous Princesses and therefore highly favoured, with much political influence throughout The Tower. 
                After meeting Baam when he first enters the Tower, she becomes quite taken with him and spends most of the story trying to find him again, even boarding the Hell Train to do so.

                    Outside the Tower, there exists a vast world, rolling skies stretch endlessly, and countless stars illuminate the darkness. 
                    A place that is a thousand times -- no, a billion times wider and freer than the tower. Once you imagine that such a world exists, don't you think all those things you want are all so trivial?

            <p>Urek Mazino (우렉 마지노, "Urek Majino") is an Irregular, currently 4th in Rank. He was the strongest active Ranker before Zahard became active once again. 
                He is also the most recent person to be part of the Top 5 High Rankers inside the Tower.
            </p>

            <p>He is considered to be on the same level as Phantaminum by weaker Rankers, however, his true rank is almost impossible to determine in terms of the Top 4 ranks because the top 2 Rankers are inactive and thus, cannot be compared with Urek. 
                He mentioned to Baam on the 43rd Floor that they would meet again later on the 77th Floor, then left the floor. His current location is unknown.

                    The same goes for me. Our bodies don't get sick or weaken as we age, they actually get stronger. But at some point, our minds get sick and become dull to everything, so we have an adverse reaction to even the smallest changes.
                    We've become weathered by time.

                He is a High Ranker, currently retaining the 3rd spot in the ranking, and the overarching ruler of Zahard's Floors and founder of the Zahard Empire while still conquering the Tower.

            <p>Infamous for his prevailing immortality, he has become the prime target of FUG.

            <p>After the events of the Hidden Floor, Zahard came out of hibernation and is active once again, making him the highest ranked Active Ranker in the Tower, right above Urek Mazino. 
                Due to his actions, Zahard can be considered the primary antagonist of the series.
