    <h1>Tower of God</h1>
    <p id="demo"><abbr title="Tower of God">TOG</abbr> is a south-korean webtoon (and my all time favorite story) written and drawn by Lee Jong-hui, 
    also known by the pen name SIU(Slave In Utero). It was published in 2010 as the first story in the <q>Talse User Universe.</q> 
    It is released and can be viewed for free on Naver and Line Webtoon websites.</p>
    <h2>Plot</h2>
    <p><span>Tower of God</span> centers around a boy called the <strong>Twenty-Fifth Bam</strong>, who has spent most of his life trapped beneath a vast and mysterious Tower, 
        with only his close friend, Rachel, to keep him company. When Rachel enters the Tower, Bam manages to open the door into it as well, 
        and faces challenges at each <em>floor</em> of this tower as he tries to find his closest companion.</p>
    <p>As the story progresses, the reader gradually explores the lore, history, and motivations of important characters and factions that drive or try to change the fate of the tower, for more than 5000 years. 
        Mysteries are gradually unveiled and added, as the readers learn about the struggles and triumphs of the inhabitants of the tower. </p>
