            <p>Sieghart Caeser is one of the main characters of the Rave Master series(a popular Japanese comic). 
                A powerful mage strongly dedicated to his mission to "preserve time". He was loosely associated with Demon Card(an evil organisation) in order to eliminate King and appears as a minor antagonist towards Haru(the series' protagonist) and friends to eliminate the 3173 girl in judgment that the power of Etherion is a direct threat to time itself. 
                After his first confrontation with Haru, Sieghart ceases fire against Elie until realizing the girl is symbiotically the key to 'time' itself upon further investigation. Upon saving Haru and co. from the Oraci√≥n Seis, he announces their companionship in order to bring peace to the world.
            </p>

                Personality:
            </h2>
            <p>
                Sieghart is a serious person. He is very adamant about his purpose of protecting the flow of time and will do anything to fulfill that purpose. He lightens and warms up considerably after joining up with Haru's group, but remains a composed and reserved person.
            </p>
